            <h3>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj  Mahal? </h3>
           
           <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one. <br>
            At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent 
            <br>than building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel 
            <br>than seeing its magnificence up close. <br>
            <br>After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <span id="place"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india">India</a>India</span> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of 
            <br>course, it’s the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors 
            <br>prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some 
            <br>Intrepid experts – from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the
             <br>bases. <br>
             <br>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and 
             <br>beyond), and so much more…

        <h1>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
       
        <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal. <br><br>
            Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian 
            <br>men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you. <br><br>
            To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.
            <br>Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from 8-day Golden Triangle tours (now with solo-only 
            <br>departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the <span id="high"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/highlights-india-and-nepal-102239">highlights of India 
                <br>and Nepal</a></span>. <br><br>
             If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from 
             <br>Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while 
             <br>you’re at it, check out their day trips in Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Mumbai!

        <div class="set4">
            <h2>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
            <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br> minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.

               <br><br> You really only need to bring the following in one small bag: <br></p>
               <ul>
                <li>Passport</li>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Medicine</li>
                <li>Camera</li>
                <li>Phone</li>
               </ul>

        </div><br>
        <div class="set5">
            <h2>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
            <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br> need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.
            <br><br>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear  <br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too. <br><br>

            <h3>Other things you need to know</h3><br>
            <p>No food is allowed inside. <br><br>

                Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed. <br><br>
                Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. <br>Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small <br>video cameras) are not allowed.

            <h2>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
            <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if <br>possible). <br>
            <br><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg" alt="pic6"> <br>
             <br>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br> amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to <br> take you there and back cheaply.) <br><br>
             <br>And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly <br> (or more!) remain in awe of it. <span id="sana"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/sana-female-intrepid-leader-india/">Sana Jinah,</a></span> one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has <br> some tips on how to do this: <br><br>

            <h2>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
            <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop. <br>
            <br><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" alt="pic8"> <br>
            <br>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br>seeking out. <br>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, Pravin  <br>Tamang. (His photography is amazing – check it out!) <br>
        </p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
            <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main <br> platform</li>
            <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
            <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
            <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br>Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br>day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p><br><br>

            <h2>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
            <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then <br>explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p><br>
            <h3>What to do in Agra</h3> <br>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is <br> also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br>Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed. <br>
               <br> One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by <br> (sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe  <br>run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their <br> stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures. <br>

        <div class="set10">
            <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3> <br>
            <p>Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br> and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit <br>it on <span id="trip"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/delhi-kathmandu-101281">this 15-day trip</a></span> from <span id="delni"><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nepal/delhi-to-kathmandu">Delhi to Kathmandu </a></span>Delhi to Kathmandu(cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p><br>
            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg" alt="pic10">
            <br><img src="picture4.png" alt="pic13" class="sr"><br><p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the ‘Pink City’, the capital of Rajasthan is full of <br>chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br> bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in. <br>
               <br> Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home <br>to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy <br> nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this 15-day trip all around <br> Rajasthan.</p>

            <h2>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h2><br>
            <p>Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br>surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – <br>applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried  <br>out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br>carried out on the historic site.</p><br>
